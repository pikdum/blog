Here's a quick list of recommended/neat Linux software:

## applications

* [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) - text editor
  - personal preference, uses vi keybinds
* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) - browser
* [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - office suite
* [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) - console file viewer
* [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/) - emails
* [Trackma](https://z411.github.io/trackma/) - anime list manager
  - haven't actually used in a while
* [feh](https://feh.finalrewind.org/) - basic image viewer
* [mpv](https://mpv.io/) - videos

## tools/utilities/cli

* [BorgBackup](https://www.borgbackup.org/) - deduplicating backup tool
* [borgmatic](https://torsion.org/borgmatic/) - wrapper for BorgBackup
* [coreutils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GNU_Core_Utilities_commands) - core utilities
* [curl](https://curl.se/) - network requests
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) - json processor
* [ncdu](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu) - disk usage analyzer
* [restic](https://restic.net/) - more modern deduplicating backup tool
  - would recommend over borg nowadays
* [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) - fast incremental file transfer
* [scrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrot) - screenshots
* [sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/) - filter text
* [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) - file download
* [xargs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs) - build + execute commands from stdin
* [xdotool](https://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/) - auto clicking and shit

The categories are a bit arbitrary. I didn't want to list every CLI command ever either, so just included some of the more neat ones.

Let me know if there are any areas I missed, or suggestions where my recommendations are shit, etc.
