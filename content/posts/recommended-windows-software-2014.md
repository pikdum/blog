Here's a ~~regularly updated~~ list of recommended Windows software.

## Browser:

[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) > [Chromium](http://chromium.woolyss.com/) > [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/chrome/browser/) >>> [Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie)

## Office Suite:

[Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/) > [Microsoft Office](https://office.microsoft.com/en-us/support/getting-started-with-office-2013-FX102809998.aspx) == [Kingsoft Office](http://www.wps.com/)

They're all pretty bad though. Consider switching to [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/).

## Email Client:

They're all shit. Just use gmail or something that actually works.

[Mailpile](https://www.mailpile.is) might not be shit, but it's still in alpha.

## PDF Reader:

[pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) == [SumatraPDF](http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/free-pdf-reader.html) >>> [Adobe Reader](https://get.adobe.com/reader/otherversions/)

Adobe Reader is nice if you like trojans and malicious scripts in your PDFs.

## Music Player:

[foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org/) > [AIMP3](http://www.aimp2.us/aimp3-download.php) >>> [WMP](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-media-player)

## Video Player:

[CCCP](http://www.cccp-project.net/) == [KCP](http://haruhichan.com/forum/showthread.php?7545-KCP-Kawaii-Codec-Pack) > [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)

Use KCP instead of CCCP if your computer isn't trash and you like to watch anime.

## Torrent Client:

[Deluge](http://deluge-torrent.org/) > [qBittorrent](http://www.qbittorrent.org/) >>> [uTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/)

A new torrent client undergoing heavy development right now is [gTorrent](https://gtorrent.github.io/).

It's shit right now, but there's a small chance that it might stop being shit in the future.
